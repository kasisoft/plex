[11-Mar-2010:KASI]

This release is based upon antsvn 1.2.1 . Nevertheless this is an unofficial patched version which
includes some changes made by myself. This patch has been added to the issue tracker under:

   http://subclipse.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=906
   
It only adds some simple convenience functions. Unfortunately there seems to be not much progress
within the antsvn code so I'm still using this unoffical patched version.
